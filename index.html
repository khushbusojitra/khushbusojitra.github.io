                            <div class="subheading mb-3">Laminds</div>
                            <p>At Laminds, I have taken on a multifaceted role that spans across various domains such as healthcare, fitness and wellness, call center operations, and pharmaceutical data management. In the Pregistry project, which is focused on healthcare and medical research, I led the development of optimized stored procedures for processing complex business logic and delivering insightful reports. My role included building Power BI dashboards to visualize vital health metrics and study results, setting up SQL Server triggers for real-time alerts and data integrity, and performing performance tuning by analyzing execution plans and maintaining indexes. I was also responsible for exception handling and monitoring data workflows to ensure operational stability. My contributions were crucial during the system migration to a high-availability SQL Server environment, significantly improving disaster recovery and uptime. I collaborated closely with cross-functional teams and supported production issues through Zoho ticketing, which sharpened my problem-solving and client communication skills.</p>
                            <p> For the YouFit project in the fitness and wellness domain, I managed critical database maintenance and job scheduling to maintain business continuity. I designed BigQuery views and stored procedures, and handled ETL processes tailored for Looker Studio dashboards to track gym performance. I developed C# applications to automate data imports from Google Sheets into BigQuery, which enhanced data reliability and timeliness. Additionally, I built and scheduled SSIS workflows and SSRS reports to streamline reporting. By restructuring Power BI data models and optimizing queries, I achieved a 30% reduction in report refresh time and improved overall system performance by 40% through stored procedure and index enhancements. These contributions not only boosted dashboard efficiency but also provided actionable insights for stakeholders.</p>
                            <p>In another critical SSIS Data Integration Project, I led the database schema design and implemented ETL packages to extract data from Excel and flat files. I also introduced mechanisms for error logging, type conversion, and data archival, ensuring smooth deployment and reliable scheduling through SQL Server Agent. </p>
                            <p>The Retro project involved integration of call center data via REST APIs using C#. I built real-time Power BI dashboards for key operational metrics and supported performance analysis by maintaining and deploying reports. This initiative helped the team assess agent productivity and make data-backed decisions.</p>    
                            <p>Additionally, I initiated a pharma data extraction project using Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and Scrapy to automate the scraping of pharmaceutical data from public sources. The data was then cleaned using Pandas and stored in MS SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL databases. I automated CSV generation and pipeline processes to support periodic reporting. These efforts demonstrated my versatility in handling both structured and semi-structured data in dynamic environments.</p>
                            <p>Throughout my journey at Laminds, I have consistently taken the initiative to lead, mentor juniors, and collaborate effectively with developers, analysts, and clients. My exposure to various tools like SSMS, Git, Jira, Slack, Zoho, Power BI, and cloud databases like BigQuery has strengthened my ability to deliver scalable and performance-driven solutions across multiple business domains.</p>

                            <div class="subheading mb-3">Srkay Consulting Group LLP</div>
                            <p>During my four-year tenure at Srkay Consulting Group, I played a pivotal role in developing and maintaining enterprise-grade ERP systems tailored for the diamond industry. My responsibilities spanned the full software development lifecycle, including designing and optimizing complex ERP modules that managed diamond inventory, pricing, order processing, and invoicing. I worked primarily with Windows Forms (WinForms) applications, where I designed intuitive user interfaces and backend processes using C# and MS SQL Server to ensure seamless data flow and user experience.</p>
                            <p>A standout achievement was the development of a highly complex diamond package print system, which required dynamically rendering layouts based on variable data structures, barcode generation, and multi-language support. This task involved deep collaboration with stakeholders to understand document formatting rules and aesthetic expectations, and I implemented the solution using Crystal Reports integrated with WinForms. The final output was a dynamic, print-ready document adaptable to different business contexts.</p>
                            <p>In my day-to-day work, I frequently collaborated directly with clients to gather detailed requirements, prepare mock-ups, present prototypes, and iteratively refine functionality based on feedback. This close communication helped in resolving real-time incidents and production issues swiftly, often through SQL debugging, code patching, and performance optimization.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, I was responsible for crafting robust stored procedures, views, and user-defined functions to support real-time reporting and transactional consistency. I drove major performance improvements by analyzing execution plans, applying query refactoring techniques, and implementing strategic indexing‚Äîreducing critical report generation time by up to 40%.</p>
                            <p>As a key contributor to the database security framework, I managed user access roles and ensured compliance with data governance standards. I also mentored junior developers, conducted code reviews, and shared best practices related to T-SQL, SSMS, and report development.</p>

During this time, I gained hands-on experience with WinForms in C# and the .NET Framework, where I developed and maintained client-server applications with user-friendly interfaces.</p>
                            <p>I enhanced my SQL Server skills, learning database architecture, relational concepts, and SQL functionality. I worked on creating stored procedures, optimizing queries, and implementing database constraints and business rules for data integrity.</p>
                            <p>In addition, I worked on improving backend schemas and refining stored procedure performance. I also became proficient in using Infragistics UI controls to develop dynamic and visually appealing user interfaces, which helped in enhancing the overall user experience of the applications.</p>

                    <p>Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. In the winter, I am an avid skier and novice ice climber. During the warmer months here in Colorado, I enjoy mountain biking, free climbing, and kayaking.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows, I am an aspiring chef, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in the front-end web development world.</p>
