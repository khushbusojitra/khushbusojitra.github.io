                            <div class="subheading mb-3">Laminds</div>
                            <p>At Laminds, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to wear many hats ‚Äî leading data-driven projects across healthcare, fitness and wellness, call center analytics, and pharmaceutical data management. Each project pushed me to learn more, do more, and drive real results for our clients.</p>
                            <p>Working on Pregistry, a healthcare and medical research platform, I spearheaded the development of high-performance stored procedures to handle complex business logic and reporting workflows. I designed and delivered Power BI dashboards that visualized crucial health metrics, giving medical teams the insights they needed in real time.

To ensure system stability, I set up SQL Server triggers for alerts, tuned execution plans, and optimized indexes ‚Äî all of which improved performance and reinforced data integrity. During a critical migration to a high-availability SQL Server environment, I played a key role, enhancing disaster recovery capabilities and minimizing downtime.

What truly stood out in this project was the collaborative spirit ‚Äî working with cross-functional teams and resolving live production issues via Zoho tickets sharpened both my problem-solving and client communication skills.</p>
                            <p> In the YouFit project, I helped transform how the company tracked gym performance and member engagement by designing BigQuery views, authoring stored procedures, and managing ETL processes tailored for Looker Studio dashboards. To improve data reliability and streamline operations, I developed a C# application that automated the import of data from Google Sheets into BigQuery, ensuring timely and accurate updates. I also managed SSIS workflows and SSRS report scheduling to support consistent, error-free reporting across departments.

One of the project‚Äôs most impactful enhancements involved converting key Looker Studio dashboards into interactive web-based reports using ASP.NET MVC integrated with BigQuery. This shift provided greater flexibility, customizability, and direct access to insights within the company‚Äôs internal tools ‚Äî helping stakeholders access reports faster and in a more user-friendly format.

My efforts in restructuring Power BI data models and optimizing backend queries led to a 30% reduction in report refresh times and a 40% improvement in overall system performance, directly enabling leadership to make faster, more informed decisions based on real-time metrics.</p>
                            <p>For an Austrian client, I led a major ETL and data integration project that involved designing robust database schemas and building SSIS packages to ingest data from Excel and flat files into SQL Server. I implemented smart mechanisms for error logging, type conversions, and data archival to ensure high reliability and data integrity throughout the pipeline. To streamline execution, I configured SQL Server Agent for intelligent scheduling and automation. Once development was complete, I successfully deployed the SSIS packages to the production server, ensuring smooth operation and monitoring in a live environment. This end-to-end ownership of the ETL workflow enhanced data consistency and significantly reduced manual intervention, delivering a scalable and maintainable solution for the client. </p>
                            <p>In the Retro project, I integrated call center data through REST APIs using C#, and developed real-time Power BI dashboards to monitor agent productivity, call volumes, and resolution times. These dashboards empowered business leaders to assess performance and act quickly on insights.</p>    
                            <p>In a self-initiated project, I created a pharmaceutical data scraping pipeline using Python (BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Pandas). I automated the extraction of public data, cleaned it, and stored it in MS SQL Server, generating CSV reports and running periodic pipeline jobs.

This project showcased my ability to work with both structured and semi-structured data while automating end-to-end reporting pipelines.</p>
                            <p>Throughout my time at Laminds, I‚Äôve stepped up to mentor junior developers, take ownership of complex systems, and collaborate across teams ‚Äî from analysts and developers to clients and support staff.

With hands-on experience in tools like SSMS, SSIS, Power BI, BigQuery, Git, Jira, Slack, and Zoho, I‚Äôve built a toolkit that helps me solve real-world problems with efficiency, scalability, and a user-first mindset.</p>

                            <div class="subheading mb-3">Srkay Consulting Group LLP</div>
                            <p>During my four-year tenure at Srkay Consulting Group, I played a pivotal role in developing and maintaining enterprise-grade ERP systems tailored for the diamond industry. My responsibilities spanned the full software development lifecycle, including designing and optimizing complex ERP modules that managed diamond inventory, pricing, order processing, and invoicing. I worked primarily with Windows Forms (WinForms) applications, where I designed intuitive user interfaces and backend processes using C# and MS SQL Server to ensure seamless data flow and user experience.</p>
                            <p>A standout achievement was the development of a highly complex diamond package print system, which required dynamically rendering layouts based on variable data structures, barcode generation, and multi-language support. This task involved deep collaboration with stakeholders to understand document formatting rules and aesthetic expectations, and I implemented the solution using Crystal Reports integrated with WinForms. The final output was a dynamic, print-ready document adaptable to different business contexts.</p>
                            <p>In my day-to-day work, I frequently collaborated directly with clients to gather detailed requirements, prepare mock-ups, present prototypes, and iteratively refine functionality based on feedback. This close communication helped in resolving real-time incidents and production issues swiftly, often through SQL debugging, code patching, and performance optimization.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, I was responsible for crafting robust stored procedures, views, and user-defined functions to support real-time reporting and transactional consistency. I drove major performance improvements by analyzing execution plans, applying query refactoring techniques, and implementing strategic indexing‚Äîreducing critical report generation time by up to 40%.</p>
                            <p>As a key contributor to the database security framework, I managed user access roles and ensured compliance with data governance standards. I also mentored junior developers, conducted code reviews, and shared best practices related to T-SQL, SSMS, and report development.</p>

                        Outside of my work as a DBA and Data Analyst, I love visiting hill stations üèîÔ∏è and spending time in natural places like hills, beaches üèñÔ∏è, and rivers üåä. I truly enjoy the peacefulness and beauty of nature üçÉ. Riding üõµ and photography üì∏ are also my favorite activities‚Äîthey let me explore new places and capture memorable moments.

                        Besides outdoor adventures, I‚Äôm passionate about discovering the latest trends and advancements in technology üíª. I often spend time learning about emerging tools üõ†Ô∏è, frameworks üìä, and innovations üöÄ that help enhance my skills and keep me up-to-date in the tech world.
