                            <div class="subheading mb-3">Laminds</div>
                            <p>At Laminds, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to wear many hats ‚Äî leading data-driven projects across healthcare, fitness and wellness, call center analytics, and pharmaceutical data management. Each project pushed me to learn more, do more, and drive real results for our clients.</p>
                            <p>Working on Pregistry, a healthcare and medical research platform, I spearheaded the development of high-performance stored procedures to handle complex business logic and reporting workflows. I designed and delivered Power BI dashboards that visualized crucial health metrics, giving medical teams the insights they needed in real time.

To ensure system stability, I set up SQL Server triggers for alerts, tuned execution plans, and optimized indexes ‚Äî all of which improved performance and reinforced data integrity. During a critical migration to a high-availability SQL Server environment, I played a key role, enhancing disaster recovery capabilities and minimizing downtime.

What truly stood out in this project was the collaborative spirit ‚Äî working with cross-functional teams and resolving live production issues via Zoho tickets sharpened both my problem-solving and client communication skills.</p>
                            <p> In the YouFit project, I helped transform how the company tracked gym performance and member engagement by designing BigQuery views, authoring stored procedures, and managing ETL processes tailored for Looker Studio dashboards. To improve data reliability and streamline operations, I developed a C# application that automated the import of data from Google Sheets into BigQuery, ensuring timely and accurate updates. I also managed SSIS workflows and SSRS report scheduling to support consistent, error-free reporting across departments.

One of the project‚Äôs most impactful enhancements involved converting key Looker Studio dashboards into interactive web-based reports using ASP.NET MVC integrated with BigQuery. This shift provided greater flexibility, customizability, and direct access to insights within the company‚Äôs internal tools ‚Äî helping stakeholders access reports faster and in a more user-friendly format.

My efforts in restructuring Power BI data models and optimizing backend queries led to a 30% reduction in report refresh times and a 40% improvement in overall system performance, directly enabling leadership to make faster, more informed decisions based on real-time metrics.</p>
                            <p>For an Austrian client, I led a major ETL and data integration project that involved designing robust database schemas and building SSIS packages to ingest data from Excel and flat files into SQL Server. I implemented smart mechanisms for error logging, type conversions, and data archival to ensure high reliability and data integrity throughout the pipeline. To streamline execution, I configured SQL Server Agent for intelligent scheduling and automation. Once development was complete, I successfully deployed the SSIS packages to the production server, ensuring smooth operation and monitoring in a live environment. This end-to-end ownership of the ETL workflow enhanced data consistency and significantly reduced manual intervention, delivering a scalable and maintainable solution for the client. </p>
                            <p>In the Retro project, I integrated call center data through REST APIs using C#, and developed real-time Power BI dashboards to monitor agent productivity, call volumes, and resolution times. These dashboards empowered business leaders to assess performance and act quickly on insights.</p>    
                            <p>In a self-initiated project, I created a pharmaceutical data scraping pipeline using Python (BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Pandas). I automated the extraction of public data, cleaned it, and stored it in MS SQL Server, generating CSV reports and running periodic pipeline jobs.

This project showcased my ability to work with both structured and semi-structured data while automating end-to-end reporting pipelines.</p>
                            <p>Throughout my time at Laminds, I‚Äôve stepped up to mentor junior developers, take ownership of complex systems, and collaborate across teams ‚Äî from analysts and developers to clients and support staff.

With hands-on experience in tools like SSMS, SSIS, Power BI, BigQuery, Git, Jira, Slack, and Zoho, I‚Äôve built a toolkit that helps me solve real-world problems with efficiency, scalability, and a user-first mindset.</p>

                            <p>During my four-year journey with Srkay Consulting Group, I was deeply immersed in building and maintaining enterprise-grade ERP systems tailored specifically for the diamond industry ‚Äî a domain that demanded precision, performance, and a high level of customization. I worked extensively with WinForms applications, designing intuitive user interfaces and crafting seamless backend logic using C# and MS SQL Server to support critical operations like diamond inventory management, pricing workflows, order processing, and invoicing.</p>
                            <p>One of the most challenging and rewarding projects I led was the development of a dynamic diamond package print system. It wasn‚Äôt just about generating printouts ‚Äî it involved creating a highly adaptable layout engine that could handle variable data structures, support barcode generation, and accommodate multi-language formatting. Working closely with stakeholders, I translated complex document formatting rules into a scalable solution using Crystal Reports, delivering a print-ready tool that became a cornerstone for business documentation.</p>
                            <p>Throughout my tenure, I maintained close client engagement ‚Äî gathering requirements, sketching out mock-ups, delivering prototypes, and refining functionality through rapid feedback loops. I handled real-time production issues by diving into SQL debugging, code patching, and performance tuning, ensuring stability in high-pressure scenarios.</p>
                            <p>On the data side, I authored and optimized dozens of stored procedures, views, and user-defined functions that powered real-time reporting and ensured transactional consistency across ERP modules. By analyzing execution plans, refactoring complex queries, and implementing strategic indexing, I was able to reduce critical report generation time by up to 40% ‚Äî directly improving user experience and operational efficiency.</p>
                            <p>Security and compliance were also within my scope. I implemented and managed user access roles and contributed to the company‚Äôs data governance standards. Beyond hands-on development, I actively mentored junior developers, led code reviews, and shared best practices in T-SQL, SSMS, and report development, helping elevate the technical bar across the team.</p>
